This code make a graphical piano keyboard using JFrame
I plugged a USB-C (into keyboard) into USB (into laptop) to run This
I also took hardwired the name of the device into the code under the name 
    it was registered as on my computer

When you play a note on the IRL piano, you get instantaneous visual feedback on the
    graphical keyboard that shows exactly what you played. It gets colored in when 
    pressed, and back to default color (black/white) when released.

If you want audio to be played on your computer, uncomment everything that says to
However it's not implemented due to latency I think with the Java synth software
    , but I have a better idea for future (and IDK how to fix it). But you already
    get perfect instant audio feedback from the piano so it's better without anyway.
